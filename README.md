### 1. Lesson Checklist

This is a suggested checklist of what each lesson should cover/contain:

- [ ] 1. README is up-to-date
	- [ ] a. Lessonâ€™s code is accurate (all snippets are syntactically correct)
	- [ ] b. Lesson can be recreated from scratch (can be done from start to finish using just the readme)
- [ ] 2. Images are committed with the project repo
	- [ ] a. Images are kept in the root of the project in `/Images`
	- [ ] b. Image names are in some way descriptive (the name describes their content, i.e. `sample_compiler_error.png`)
	- [ ] c. Images that are part of a series are suffixed by a number to indicate their order (i.e, `line_graph_1.png`, `line_graph_2.png`)
	- [ ] d. Images are used liberally to illustrate concepts, show code/IDE, display relevant gifs, etc. 
- [ ] 3. README separated into appropriate sections
   	- [ ] a. **Title**
	- [ ] b. **Objectives**: 1+ Bullet points on what is going to be learned and why it is important
	- [ ] c. **Vocabulary**: Relevant vocabulary used in the lesson, along with a 1-line definition and link to the expanded definition
	- [ ] d. **Readings**: Prerequisite reading for understanding the lesson
	- [ ] e. **Further Reading**: More advanced reading, includes resource reading for the "Advanced" exercises
	- [ ] f. **Resources**: Documentation, developer tools, etc.
	- [ ] g. *Main Lesson*: All of the contents of the main lesson; each topic is its own section title
	- [ ] h. *Interspersed Exercises*: No formal section for this; just that the lesson contains small, occassional breakout exercises or theory discussion questions
	- [ ] i. **Exercises**: Extends lesson or provides more practice of a concept
	- [ ] j. **Advanced**: At least 1 optional, advanced exercise provided for students to complete after the core exercises are completed
- [ ] 4. Master branch is fork-ready (project is set up right where the day's lesson begins, including any starter code)
	- [ ] a. Completed lesson is located in `solution` branch
	- [ ] b. `solution` branch can be run as-is if it is cloned
	- [ ] c. There are no other branches other than `master` and `solution`
- [ ] 5. Exercise solutions are in separate markdown in same repo (where appropriate)
	- [ ] a. Solutions are stored in `/Exercises/Exercises.md` (where appropriate)
	- [ ] b. Solutions clearly marked and hidden w/ `<summary><detail>` tags (if they are interspersed exercises). 
	- [ ] c. 2-5 exercises for each lesson
	- [ ] d. Homework assignment exercises are fully tested
- [ ] 6. If this is a multipart lesson, the base of subsequent lessons is the full solution to prior lesson

#### Estimated Time for Revising a Lesson Based on Category:

| Category | Time Estimate (hours) |
|---|---|
| Good to go/Needs minor changes | ~1-3 |
| Needs Some Revision | ~3-4 |
| Needs Significant Work | ~5-7 |
